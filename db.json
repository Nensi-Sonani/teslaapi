Application is quick and allows users to easily fill in paint chips to a smooth surface within a few simple steps. This paint system is a two stage process of applying paint to cover the defect and then blending the excess paint to smooth the finish. This process can be repeated multiple times to build layers of paint and fill in chips of varying depth per the desired results."
